        <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p> As you know my name is Vichakshan Maturu, but I go by "Vick" for short. I am currently dual majoring in Computer Science and Data Science at Rutgers University. 
            I am expected to graduate in December 2025. I was born on October 12th 2003 in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. I moved to the United States in 2005 to
            Louisville, Kentucky where I lived for 4 years until I moved to Houston, Texas. My entire childhood I grew up in Houston, when until in October 2020 we moved to 
            Monroe Township, New Jersey. Now we relocated to South Brunswick, New Jersey. 
            
            I live with my family for 4 including me, my younger sister <em>Saanvi</em>,my mother <em>Pushpa</em> and my father <em>Param</em>.
            
            I really wish to work in the Aerospace Industry some day, and hope to take my degrees there. 
            I am really interested in internships, externships, and full time positions.
